# Famoco Front-end Technical Test

Front-end exercise: tables and APIs

In this exercise, you will develop a SPA with React/Redux to browse the endpoints of an API of your choice from the following list: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
<br/>
<br/>
Requirements <br>
- The API choice needs to make sense in a table format
- Showcase a data table with a brief description
- The data table has to be minimum three columns and must be paginated
- The user can click on elements of the table and see the full description of the item
- Use React and Redux
- Choose your own UI framework (internally we use Material-UI, but you are free to use whatever you want)
- Design and UI matter to us: give them some love
